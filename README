This repo hosts a few quick and dirty scripts I wrote for an assignment 
in one of my classes at RIT. The file format Python scripts all require
exiftool to be installed before they can be run. chart.py requires 
that the plotly Python module be installed. These scripts were
designed to work in Kali Linux.
